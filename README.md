This project was quite challenging for me. I suppose it is challenging any time you're asked to write a paper in a foreign language for the first time. It helped me to understand how the language talks to itself: I still don't think I totally get it, but it works, darn it. I didn't try to use anything more complicated than functions, a loop or two, and some conditional statements this time, but there's always the next one.
